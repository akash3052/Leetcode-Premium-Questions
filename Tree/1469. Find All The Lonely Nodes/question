In a binary tree, a lonely node is a node that is the only child of its parent node. The root of the tree is not lonely because it does not have a parent node.

Given the root of a binary tree, return an array containing the values of all lonely nodes in the tree. Return the list in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: [4]
Explanation: Light blue node is the only lonely node.
Node 1 is the root and is not lonely.
Nodes 2 and 3 have the same parent and are not lonely.
